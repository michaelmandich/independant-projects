the way to use this program is as follows.
Do you have a text file or a multitude of text files that you would like to conform to a certain length, but are too lazy to do it by hand?
either put a directory name or a file name ending in .txt, and then a space and a numberwhen running this file, and my program will wrap all
 the files in the directory with this wraplength, it will not cut words off and can do massive files in a matter of millseconds.
ran from the directory as follows, in command line
./ww yourfilename.txt 30
^above would make a file of character length 30 in a single column in your text file.
